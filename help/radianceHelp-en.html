	<p><span style=" font-size:14pt; font-weight:600;">Contribution to the luminous halo (Radiance)</span></p><!-- <p><span style=" font-size:10pt; font-weight:600;">This indicator makes it possible to evaluate the illuminated areas emitting the most in the blue part of the spectrum..</span></p> -->
	<p ><span style=" font-size:8pt;">The objective of this indicator is to classify the lit areas according to their contribution to the luminous halo, based on their level of radiance. It is not a question here of directly modeling the luminous halo but of classifying the geographical units (grid) according to the emissions upwards, captured by the satellite and contributing to the formation of the luminous halo.</span></p>
	<p ><span style=" font-size:10pt; font-weight:600;">Input parameters</span></p>
	<ul>
		<li>Extent zone : Extent of the study area used to delimit the calculated indicator.</li>
		<li>Satellite Image: Night Satellite Image in raster format (image with 3 RGB bands, or with a single band which corresponds to the total radiance).</li>
		
		<li>Choice of grid: Grid on which the indicator will be calculated, it can be imported or created.
		<ul>
			<li>Import a grid: Grid vector layer already created.</li>
			<li>Create a grid :</li>
			
			<ul><li>Diameter : Grid diameter, meters</li><li>Grid type: Type of the grid to create.</li></ul>
		</ul></li></ul>
	<p ><span style=" font-size:10pt; font-weight:600;">Output data</span></p>
	<ul>
		<li>Statistics Radiance Output : Vector layer representing the average radiance calculated by grid with a classification by quantile in 5 classes from the lowest values ​​to the highest, with also a class representing the grid without radiance.</li>
		
		<li>Raster total Radiance Output : Raster layer with the total radiance per pixel (only if the input satellite image has at least 3 spectral bands).</li>
