	<p><span style=" font-size:14pt; font-weight:600;">Visibility Light Source</span></p>
	<p ><span style=" font-size:8pt;">The light source visibility indicator allows to evaluate at each grid, the number of light sources visible by an observatur at a given height.<br/>It requires several data calculated in tab 1 and 2, to then calculate the results in tab 3.</span></p>
	<p><span style=" font-size:10pt; font-weight:600;">Number of visible lights</span></p>
	<p ><span style=" font-size:8pt;">The indicator represent the number of light sources by grid (imported or created) observed according to the relief, the height of the observer and the light sources. A mask is also applied to remove the illumination on the walls of the upper frame at a certain height as a parameter.</span></p>
	<p ><span style=" font-size:10pt; font-weight:600;">Input parameters</span></p>
	<ul>
		<li>Extent zone : Extent of the study area used to delimit the calculated indicator.</li>
		<li>Layer from viewshed : Raster layer from viewshed processing.</li>
		
		<li>Raster buildings vegetation : Raster layer created during the calculation of the DSM, which removes the illumination on the building and the vegetation (if present).</li>
		<li>Max. observer height : Height in meters from which it is considered that the observer will not go, it must normally be identical to the height of the observer indicated in the calculation of the viewshed.</li>
		
		<li>Choice of grid : Grid on which the indicator will be calculated, it can be imported or created.
		<ul>
			<li>Import a grid: Grid vector layer already created.</li>
			<li>Create a grid :</li>
			
			<ul><li>Diameter : Grid diameter, meters</li><li>Grid type: Type of the grid to create.</li></ul>
		</ul></li>
		<li>Bounds for last class : Indicates the bounds of the last class of symbology represented, by default 50 light sources.</li>
	</ul>
	<p ><span style=" font-size:10pt; font-weight:600;">Output data</span></p>
	<ul>
		<li>Raster Number of visible lights : Raster layer, represinting the number of visible light sources per pixels with the mask.</li>
		
		<li>Number of visible lights per grid : Vector layer representing the average number of light sources per grid.</li>
